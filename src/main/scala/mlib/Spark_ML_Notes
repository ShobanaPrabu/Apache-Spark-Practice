Spark provides 2 libraries for implementing the machine learning.
    a) MLlib
    b) ML Pipeline


MLlib -> Is the only machine learning library in Spark. It provides machine learninig algorithms which are used to
create models.
Creating a machine learning model involves several stages of data preparation, post-processing,  and validations.
Data traverses through different steps before delivering back the results to us.


With ML pipelines introduction in Apache Spark, it's easy to handle machine leaning work flow.

Different terminologies that are used in Spark ML.

1) Dataframes: Its a structrued representation of data.
2) Transformers : These are used to transform or convert one dataframe to another.
3) Estimators:
